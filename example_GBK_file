In 1995, China National Information Technology Standardization
Technical Committee set down the Chinese Internal Code Specification
(Chinese: ºº×ÖÄÚÂëÀ©Õ¹¹æ·¶£¨GBK£©; pinyin: H¨¤nz¨¬ N¨¨im¨£
Ku¨°zh¨£n Gu¨©f¨¤n (GBK)), Version 1.0, known as GBK 1.0, which is a
slight extension of Codepage 936. The newly added 95 characters were not
found in GB 13000.1-1993, and were provisionally assigned Unicode PUA
code points.
